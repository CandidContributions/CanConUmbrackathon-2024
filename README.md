## Signing the Guestbook

We would love everyone who joined us at any point on Zoom or on Discord to sign [our 'pumpkin patch' Guestbook](https://candidcontributions.com/umbrackathon-2022/guestbook). It's a good way to warm up those pull request skills!

To sign it, in short, you need to create a pull request adding a new file in the `Guestbook` folder called `YourGitHubUsername.md` with the contents as shown below. But here are more detailed instructions in case needed: 

- Navigate to the `Guestbook` folder in this repository
- Click the `Add file` button and select to `Create a new file`. You will be informed that this will create a new branch in a fork in your GitHub account, which is exactly what you want to do, thank you GitHub!
- Name the file `YourGitHubUsername.md`
- Add the required information as shown below, or copy the contents of `Guestbook/0-template.md`
- Click the 'Propose New File' button
- Follow GitHub's instructions to create a pull request

When we receive notification of your PR (pull request) we will review it and if done correctly, will merge it. You'll then appear in the guestbook. And then congratulations for your first pull request of the hackathon!

### Information to include in YourGitHubUsername.md

```
NAME: {your display name, we'll get your GitHub username from the name of the file}

LOCATION: {your general location, if you are happy to share it}

MESSAGE: {optional message to include in the guestbook}

```

Check other people's files in the `Guestbook` folder if you're not sure.
